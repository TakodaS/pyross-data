# pyross-data

Data for [PyRoss](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pyross) and [PyRossGeo](https://github.com/lukastk/PyRossGeo)

Notebooks are to be placed under `notebooks/` and must output a `csv` file to `data/`. Every day at midnight the notebooks are run and the resulting `csv` file is pushed to the repo.
